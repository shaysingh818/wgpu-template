# wgpu-template
This is a starter template for creating programs that use WGPU! This template includes a 3d camera, instancing, model loading, and textures. The purpose of this is to have the needed boiler plate code for creating a graphics program that could have multiple rendering pipelines. 

## Setup
Click "use this template" and create a new repository. Clone the repository generated from the template. Make sure rust is installed and run the cargo build command. 
```
cargo run
```
